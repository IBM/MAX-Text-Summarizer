' gordon 's impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by dr phil last week and due to air today . weeping and wailing and at times incoherent , gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by dr phil . gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story . he has felt ` vilified ' and ` depicted as a monster ' since january 31 when bobby kristina , 22 , was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ at the roswell , georgia home he and bobby kristina shared . breakdown : with his mother , michelle , by his side nick gordon struggles to stay coherent . troubling preview : a trailer for the interview of bobbi kristina brown 's boyfriend nick gordon by dr phil mcgraw was released sunday night . swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by dr phil . but on learning of gordon 's emotional , mental and physical state dr phil could not ` in good conscience ' go on with the interview . according to gordon 's mother , michelle , who was by her son 's side during the highly emotional intervention , ` nicholas is at a breaking point . he can not bear not being without __krissy__ , by her side . he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . ' dr phil told gordon , who admitted to having taken xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting : ` nick , you 're out of control . you 've threatened suicide . you deserved to get some help because if you do n't , you know you 're going to wind up dead . ' he added : ` you 've got to get yourself cleaned up . you got to man up and straighten up . ' yesterday dailymail.com revealed that , barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with dr phil , gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk . the disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by dr phil as ` exponential . ' in the show , due to broadcast wednesday , a weeping and wailing gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed : ` i 'm so sorry for everything . ' asked if he still intended to kill himself he said : ` if anything happens to __krissi__ i will . ' he said : ` my pain is horrible . my heart hurts . i have panic attacks . ' in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills . gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed . according to dr phil : ` he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster . ' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he __alternated__ between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see __kriss__ . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt . ' leaning towards gordon 's mother , dr phil said : ` you and i have one mission with one possible outcome and that 's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression , his guilt ... and to get clean and sober . ' he added : ` his life absolutely hangs in the balance . ' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub . just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , __leolah__ brown , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ` strong __evidene__ of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events . she posted : ` nick gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family . moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' __leolah__ made her claims in response to being invited onto dr phil 's show . tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . in her message she wrote : ` with all due respect , nick gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece ... . we have strong evidence of foul play . ' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that gordon has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived . and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them -lsb- whitney and bobbi kristina -rsb- . ' railing against the decision by bobbi 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ` my name will be the first she calls . ' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ` failure ' to revive bobbi kristina . his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier . ' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . ` are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her __bath-tub__ just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs . '' gordon has now entered a rehab facility in atlanta . meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma . it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina -- __krissi__ as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the __bath-tub__ of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia . unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation . while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with nick , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged . in an interview with the sun a friend of the couple , steven __stepho__ , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute __roxicodone__ . sounding eerily similar to bobbi 's mother and father 's __drug-dependent__ relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on . ` bobbi and nick would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had . it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs . ` there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed . there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice . she was always covered in cigarette burns . ' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control __krissi__ to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to __stepho__ : ` but __krissi__ really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it . ' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , steven __stepho__ , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute __roxicodone__ ."
